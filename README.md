 * **Algebraic modeling is a composition of techniques that can be used to produce geometry.**
 * **The basic idea is that we will start with an _implicit_ shape, like a sphere, then produce a chain of _domain distortions_ that will bend the sphere into a desired shape.**
 * **The end result is a single polynomial that describes the shape we want.**

* **For a function _f_ of one real variable _x_ we can plot _f(x) = y_ in Cartesian coordinates**
* **Here, and for the next few slides our _f(x)_ is a gaussian curve.**
* **By rearranging the terms, we can turn our _f(x)_ into a function of 2D space _f(x, y)_.**
* **For all positions _<x, y>_ in the space, the positions with _f(x, y) = 0_ are on the _image_ of the real line.**
